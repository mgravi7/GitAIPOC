feat: Restructure project for production deployment

Major Restructuring:
==================

1. Directory Structure
   - Renamed code-review-agent/ ? gitlab-code-review-agent/
   - Organized code into src/ folder (Python package structure)
   - Created tests/ folder for future unit tests
   - Separated testing environments:
     * local-testing/ - Local GitLab CE testing
     * org-gitlab-testing/ - Corporate GitLab testing

2. Code Organization
   - gitlab-code-review-agent/src/ - Production agent code
     * app.py - FastAPI webhook handler
     * config.py - Environment configuration
     * gitlab_client.py - GitLab API client
     * claude_reviewer.py - Anthropic API integration
     * __init__.py - Package initialization
   - Updated imports to use src. prefix
   - Updated Dockerfile to run as Python module

3. Testing Environments
   - local-testing/ - Test with local GitLab CE
     * docker-compose.yml - GitLab CE + Agent
     * .env.example - Local testing configuration
   - org-gitlab-testing/ - Test with corporate GitLab
     * docker-compose.yml - Agent only (connects to corp GitLab)
     * .env.example - Corporate testing configuration

4. Documentation Structure
   - docs/deployment/
     * local-testing.md - Local testing guide
     * corporate-testing.md - Corporate GitLab testing guide
     * production-kubernetes.md - K8s deployment (placeholder)
   - docs/development/
     * service-account-setup.md - GitLab service account setup
     * environment-variables.md - Configuration reference (placeholder)
     * troubleshooting.md - Common issues (placeholder)
     * local-development.md - Development guide (placeholder)

5. Updated Documentation
   - README.md - Comprehensive guide for developers & DevOps
   - gitlab-code-review-agent/README.md - Agent-specific docs
   - Separate testing guides for local vs corporate scenarios

Architecture Decisions:
======================

- Separate folders for local vs corporate testing (explicit clarity)
- Two .env.example files (one per testing scenario)
- src/ directory structure (Python best practices)
- Keep gitlab-cr-agent/ submodule as reference
- Focus on Anthropic Claude models only
- No Kubernetes manifests yet (DevOps team will follow their standards)

Migration Path:
==============

- Current: GitHub.com repository for development
- Next: Clone to work computer, migrate to corporate GitLab
- Future: Corporate GitLab becomes primary repository

Production Readiness:
====================

- Docker image builds cleanly
- Environment-based configuration
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Health check endpoint
- Clear separation between POC and production code
- Ready for DevOps team handoff

Testing:
========

- Successfully tested with local GitLab CE
- Validated against real merge request
- Claude Sonnet 4 integration working
- Cost: ~$0.15/review, ~$30/month for 50 MRs/week

Breaking Changes:
================

- Code moved from code-review-agent/ to gitlab-code-review-agent/src/
- Docker compose files split into local-testing/ and org-gitlab-testing/
- Imports changed to use src. prefix
- Old docker-compose.yml removed (replaced with testing-specific versions)

Reference:
=========

- gitlab-cr-agent/ submodule kept for advanced feature reference
- No current plans to expand beyond Anthropic models
- Can refactor later if multi-model support needed

Version: 1.0.0
Status: Production-Ready
